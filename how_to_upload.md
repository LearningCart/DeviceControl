## 🚀 Uploading Files to Raspberry Pi Pico

Before uploading, make sure your Raspberry Pi Pico is **flashed with MicroPython firmware**.  
Download from: [https://micropython.org/download/rp2-pico](https://micropython.org/download/rp2-pico)

---

### 📁 1. Uploading with `rshell` (Command Line)

**Install rshell:**
```bash
pip install rshell
```

**Connect to the Pico:**
```bash
rshell -p /dev/ttyACM0  # or COMx on Windows
```

**Upload files to Pico:**
```bash
cp lcd_api.py /pyboard/
cp pico_i2c_lcd.py /pyboard/
cp main.py /pyboard/
```

**Other commands:**
- `ls /pyboard/` — List files on the device
- `repl` — Enter MicroPython REPL from rshell

---

### 💻 2. Using REPL (Interactive Terminal)

Use tools like `screen`, `minicom`, or `putty` to access REPL:

```bash
screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200
```

At the `>>>` prompt:
- Type Python commands directly
- Press `Ctrl-E` to enter *paste mode*, paste code, then `Ctrl-D` to run

> Best for quick testing or small code snippets

---

### 🧠 3. Using Thonny IDE (Beginner-Friendly GUI)

**Step-by-step:**
1. Download from [https://thonny.org](https://thonny.org)
2. Connect Pico via USB
3. Go to **Tools → Options → Interpreter**
   - Choose **MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)**
   - Select the correct port

**Upload files:**
- Open a file (e.g., `main.py`)
- Click **File → Save As → MicroPython device**
- Repeat for all necessary files (`lcd_api.py`, `pico_i2c_lcd.py`, etc.)

> You can also run scripts directly for live testing!

---

### 📂 Typical Files to Upload

- `main.py` – Your main application
- `devices.json, devicestate.json` configuration files.,
- `other *.py` modules of this project
- `lcd_api.py` – LCD driver APIs
- `pico_i2c_lcd.py` – I2C LCD Driver
